## 🚀 Getting Started

### ▶️ Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload neural_network_101.ipynb
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially

### 💻 Run Locally

git clone https://github.com/slickdog99/neural-network-101.git
cd your-repo-name
jupyter notebook neural_network_101.ipynb
🧮 Sample Functions

def get_predictions(a2):
    return np.argmax(a2, 0)

def get_accuracy(predictions, y):
    print(predictions, y)
    return np.sum(predictions == y) / y.size
These functions are used to extract predicted labels from the output layer and compute classification accuracy.

🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to:

Structure a basic neural network

Perform forward propagation using matrix operations

Apply softmax and compute categorical cross-entropy loss

Derive predictions and evaluate accuracy

Understand how the gradient of the loss with respect to Z₂ simplifies to A2 - Y when using softmax + cross-entropy

📚 References & Inspiration
Derivative of the Softmax Function and the Categorical Cross Entropy Loss — This article helped me understand how the derivative of the softmax function combined with the cross-entropy loss simplifies to a very elegant equation: A2 - Y. Highly recommended for anyone trying to grasp this key concept in backpropagation.
